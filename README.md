# Spacetime SCM

*A version control system where your code obeys the laws of physics.*

---

## Why Spacetime?

Traditional version control treats all code as equal. Spacetime recognizes that **code has mass, history has gravity, and some changes are cosmic events.**

### The Problem
- Technical debt accumulates invisibly
- Breaking changes cause endless "can we revert?" debates  
- Legacy code becomes riskier to touch but hard to identify
- Merge conflicts from ancient branches surprise everyone

### The Solution
Spacetime makes software evolution **quantifiable through physics**:
- **Gravitational Mass** = code complexity + dependencies + age
- **Redshift** = gradual code obfuscation over time
- **Event Horizons** = commits that cannot be reversed
