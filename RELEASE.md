Spacetime is a version control system which recognizes that as stars and galaxies evolve, so does your codebase.  
It ages, gains complexity, and accumulates technical debt. By modeling code evolution through astrophysics, Spacetime introduces novel concepts like **Redshift**, **Event Horizons**, and **Branch Gravity** to help developers manage the lifecycle of their code more effectively.

# Features  

Redshift — Tracks code aging and readability decay over time, helping you identify stale or legacy files.

Event Horizon — Marks irreversible commits that cannot be reverted, ensuring proper handling of breaking changes.

Branch Gravity — Calculates gravitational “mass” of branches to predict merge difficulty and avoid long-lived branch divergence.

Wormhole Merges — Allows parallel-feature merges without destroying either implementation (experimental).

Dark Matter Detection — Finds unused code, dead dependencies, and invisible technical debt affecting performance.

Quantum Entanglement — Synchronizes branches or repositories so commits appear across linked codebases automatically.

Gravity Map Visualization — Shows your repository as a dynamic galaxy with star-like files and orbital branches.

Redshift Timeline — Heatmap-style visualization of code aging and predicted readability issues.

Cosmic Insights — Full physics-based meta-analysis combining redshift, mass, gravity, and event horizon data.

Custom SCM Layer — Implements its own object storage, pack system, and commit model designed around physics concepts.
